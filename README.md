OpenClassrooms # Projet-2---Int√©gration-site-agence-de-voyage

/* Project overview */
Welcome to Booki, a (fictional) travel booking website. I developed this webpage based on a Figma design (see below) using HTML and CSS only. It is currently a pure front-end project / interface project with no JavaScript.
My website is fully responsive. It has been tested down to 300px wide. It has been sucessfully tested on Chromium and Firefox on desktop, and Safari on mobile.

/* Technical brief and specs */
- navigation bar with hover effect
- input field for searching cities
- filter buttons with hover effect
- clickable accomodation and activity cards
- fully responsive for desktop, tablet and mobile displays with breakpoints for tablet (992px) and mobile (768px) and a maximum width of 1400px
